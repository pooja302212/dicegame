🎲 Dice Game  

**A simple web-based Dice Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!**  

## 🚀 About the Project  
This is my first web development project where I built a fun dice game. Two players roll a dice, and the player with the higher number wins!  

### 🎮 How It Works  
- Click the "Roll Dice" button.  
- Two dice are rolled (one for each player).  
- The player with the higher number wins!  
- If both get the same number, it's a draw.  

### 🔥 What U will Learn  
✅ Structuring a webpage with **HTML**  
✅ Styling the UI using **CSS**  
✅ Adding interactivity with **JavaScript** (DOM manipulation, event listeners)  
 

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

### 🎯 Future Improvements  
- Add animations for rolling dice  
- Sound effects for better experience  
- Score tracking for multiple rounds
